# Useless Projects:
## [GPS Frame Parser]:
A gui program in python to decode a [NMEA] Frame.
## [Password Sandbox]:
It's a small gui program in python to create strong passwords and test the strength of your passwords.
  ## I love to code, so to practice:
  ### I create stupid projects like [Raccourci].
  ### So I created "Useless Projects" for my *Useless Projects*, ***Yes it makes sense***.
  ### So don't expect big and useful projects.
  ## But, if you have any advice for me:
  ### I take it completely.  I'm just a student.
